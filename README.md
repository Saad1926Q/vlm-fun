So I am planning on going all in on VLMs.  
In this repo, I'll be adding the code related to the stuff I'll be doing.

Also, you can check out my [Twitter](https://x.com/sodakeyEatsMush) where I post ML-related stuff.

Some stuff I've been following includes content by [Umar Jamil](https://www.youtube.com/@umarjamilai) and the [Vision Language Models Bootcamp](https://courses.opencv.org/courses/course-v1:Vision-Language-Models+Bootcamp+VLMs/course/) offered by OpenCV.
